PRIVACY PRESERVATION USING NETWORK CODING AGAINST TRAFFIC ANALYSIS IN WIRELESS NETWORK

To run a Tcl script with nam and xgraph in Windows and MacBook, follow the steps below:

1. Download and install the appropriate version of the NS-2 network simulator for your operating system. You can find the download links on the NS-2 website.

2. Download and install the nam and xgraph visualization tools. These tools are usually included with the NS-2 installation or can be downloaded separately.

3. Open a terminal window or command prompt on your computer.

4. Navigate to the directory where your Tcl script is located using the "cd" command.

5. To run the script with nam and xgraph, enter the following command in the terminal window:

   
   ns filename.tcl
   

   This will execute the Tcl script and generate output files that can be visualized with nam and xgraph.

6. To open the nam visualization tool, enter the following command in the terminal window:

   
   nam filename.nam
   

   This will open the nam window and display the network topology and traffic flow.

7. To open the xgraph visualization tool, enter the following command in the terminal window:

   
   xgraph filename.xg
   

   This will open the xgraph window and display the graphical output generated by the Tcl script.

Note: The steps may vary slightly depending on the version of NS-2 and the operating system you are using.
